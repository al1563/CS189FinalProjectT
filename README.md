### **Project T**
### Week 10: The SVD and PCA. Minimum norm solutions. The idea of brain-machine interfaces.

This repo contains 2 lectures worth of materials. 

### Folders:
* **Lecture and Notes**: This folder contains 2 slidedecks (Lecture 1: SVD and PCA. Lecture 2: Minimum norm solution, brain machine interfaces) and a full set of lecture notes
* **Assignments and Quizzes**: This folder contains 4 assignments on the topics: SVD, PCA, Minimum Norm solutions, and Spike Sorting for BCI. Short quizzes are also provided to check for student understanding on the topic. 

### Learning Objectives:
* Understand methods of matrix decompositions (and why this is useful for solving systems of linear equations)
* Understand theory behind SVD and what operations each of the decomposed matrices represent.
* Understand how to program SVD decomposition.
* Apply concepts in SVD to perform PCA.
* Understand relationship between singular values, eigenvalues, and principal components.
* Understand high level the idea of latent spaces and PCA as an embedding algorithm.
* Identify and solve a minimum norm problem.
* Understand the application of Moore Penrose inverse in underdetermined equations.
* Prove that Moore Penrose inverse gives the minimum norm solution in a system of underdetermined equations.
* Describe what Brain Computer Interfaces represents
* Describe some applications of BCI and where machine learning can be applied. 
* Be able to apply PCA to perform spike sorting
* Given neural recording data associated with a classification task (e.g. move a mouse cursor to left or to the right), the student should be able to (a) preprocess the data (b) split the data into training, (validation), and testing sets and (c) apply a machine learning model to perform classification (the student should at least be able to perform linear regression)
